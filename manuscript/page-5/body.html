        <h2> Synopsis </h2>
        <p class="beginning">
            Priyanka Chopra is born under Aries ascendant, whose Lord Mars is placed in 6th House with a Saturn—meaning she will forever be energetic, enthusiastic and straightforward. Her sunsign drives for ambition, maturity and an urge to see oneself as catalyst of change in the society.
        </p>
        <p>
            The conjunction between Saturn and Mars on her chart bears her the ability and determination to focus like Arjuna. She will strive for perfection, sometimes even irrationally, but will be quick to step back if it's necessary. Bharani, the Nakshatra lord of her Ascendent, depicts her creative side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Priyanka has an exalted Moon in the Earthy sign of Taurus, the Rohini Nakshatra, blessing her with a strong and beautiful personality. Rohinis are excellent at singing and dancing, and are very appealing to look at—qualities essential for a successful actor.
