    <h2> Philanthrophist</h2>
        <p>
        Priyanka is known for being a philanthropist becoming a voice for needy children and abused women. This is so obvious because of her Moon being in Taurus, giving support to women/children. Sun, the 5th lord of children is close to her heart, placed in the 4h house. It is in Punarvasu which can mean bringing back prosperity for them.

         Sun in the 1st division of Cancer gives her the ability to solve problems for others and a caring and healing attitude. Jupiter in Libra wants to bring back justice and fair rules where it is lacking. This Jupiter aspects her 1st house of Self. Thus, she suits the role so well as a person working with the UNICEF.
