        <h2> Philanthrophy</h2>
        <p>
            Priyanka will remain a philanthropist for life and continue to be the voice of the needyâ€”particularly children and women. Since her Moon is placed in Taurus, she will be dedicated to supporting the cause of women and children all around the world. Sun, the 5th lord of children is placed in the 4<sup>th</sup> house of her birth chart. It is in her <em> Punarvasu Nakshatra</em> that helps her give back and wish prosperity for others.

            Sun in the first division of Cancer gives her the ability to help others, be of caring nature with a healing attitude. Jupiter in her Libra drives her pursuit to put a balance on things or bring back justice or fair rules whereever it's lacking. It also aspects her first house of self, making her very suitable (with a punch) for the role with the UNICEF. Priyanka will literally use her talents to help others shine and this quality will also make India very proud about her. </p>
