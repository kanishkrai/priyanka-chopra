        <h2> Is marriage on cards yet? </h2>
        <p>
            On Priyanka's chart Saturn is aspecting the 7<sup>th</sup> lord, Venus, a signifier of the 7<sup>th</sup> house that causes delay in traditional Indian marriage or in finding a life partner of choice. It is expected that Priyanka will tie the nuptial knot a little differently and only somewhat later than usual in life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her Venus subperiod begins from July 2018â€”a time when she might meet a man of her dreams and end up getting into a serious long term relationship. With Venus-Rahu conjunction and Venus being the lord of 7<sup>th</sup> house of marriage there is a chance that Priyanka could be swept off by someone of foreign origin or a completely different lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p> Overall, marriage is not on the cards for Priyanka but love is. Especially, in 2018. Her Venus subperiod is likely to last for three years until 2021. </p>
