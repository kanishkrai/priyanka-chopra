            Priyanka has the great benefit of Jupiter aspecting her 1<sup>st</sup> house of Self. This is going to give her a huge image in front of the public, always helping and supporting her identity and physical being. Libra in the 7<sup>th</sup> house keeps her in constant touch and closeness with her fans. Acting, including dance and music, is an art form that she would personifies well and openly, which is also how Jupiter with Libra in the 7<sup>th</sup> house (of Others) plays out in real life.
