        <h2> Marriage On The Cards Yet? </h2>
        <p>
            Saturn is aspecting the 7th lord, Venus, which is also the significator of the 7th house, which causes delay in the marriage most of the times. So we expect a nuptial committment somewhat later than usual in her case.
        </p>

            <p>From July'2018 begins the Venus Sub period. She might meet the man of her dreams that she could be seriously wanting a relationship with during this time. With Venus-Rahu conjunction and Venus being the lord of 7th house of marriage denoting that she could have relationship with someone who may be a foreigner or someone with different lifestyle than her. </p>
