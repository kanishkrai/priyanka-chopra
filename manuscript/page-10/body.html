        <p>
            Regarding marriage, Saturn aspecting the 7th lord, Venus, which is also the significator of the same, delays it most of the times. So we expect a legal committment somewhat later than usual in her case.
        </p>

            <p>From July'2018 begins the Venus Sub period. She may meet a person that she could be seriously wanting a relationship with during this time. Venus Rahu conjunctions and the former being lord of the 7th house of marriage, relationships in her chart usually gives connections with people who are not of the same community as hers. </p>
